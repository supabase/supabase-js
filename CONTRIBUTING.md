# Contributing to Supabase JS Libraries

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Supabase JavaScript SDK! This guide will help you get started with contributing to the Supabase JS monorepo.

> **Repository Structure Changed:** This repository has been restructured as a monorepo. **All libraries, including `supabase-js`, are now under `packages/core/`**. If you previously contributed to `supabase-js`, `auth-js`, `postgrest-js`, `realtime-js`, `storage-js`, or `functions-js`, please read our **[Migration Guide](docs/MIGRATION.md)** to understand:
>
> - Where your code moved (everything is now in `packages/core/<library-name>/`)
> - How commands changed (`npm test` → `pnpm nx test <library-name>`)
> - New workflow with Nx

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (version 20 or higher)
- **pnpm** (enable via `corepack enable` — the workspace pins the version in `package.json`)
- **Docker** (required for integration tests)
- **Git**

### Initial Setup

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/supabase-js.git
   cd supabase-js
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   corepack enable
   pnpm install
   ```

4. **Build all packages**:

   ```bash
   pnpm nx run-many --target=build --all
   ```

5. **Run tests** to ensure everything works:

   ```bash
   pnpm nx affected --target=test
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. **Create a new branch** from `master` (the default branch — features, fixes, and chores all start here). Branch from `v3` only when working on v3-only breaking changes:

   ```bash
   git checkout master
   git pull upstream master
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   ```

   v3-only breaking changes target the `v3` branch directly. The `v3` branch is kept in sync with `master` periodically via a maintainer-run merge — no per-PR action needed from contributors.

2. **Make your changes** in the appropriate library under `packages/core/`

3. **Follow our coding standards**:
   - Use TypeScript for all new code
   - Follow existing code style and patterns
   - Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
   - Use meaningful commit messages (see [Commit Guidelines](#-commit-guidelines))

4. **Test your changes**:

   ```bash
   # Run affected tests
   pnpm nx affected --target=test

   # Run specific library tests
   pnpm nx test <package-name>
   ```

   For detailed testing instructions, see [TESTING.md](./docs/TESTING.md) and the README in each package directory.

5. **Format your code**:

   ```bash
   pnpm nx format
   ```

6. **Build affected packages**:

   ```bash
   pnpm nx affected --target=build
   ```

## Commit Guidelines

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) with automated tooling to ensure consistent commit messages and enable automatic versioning.

### Using the Interactive Commit Tool

**You can use the interactive commit tool** instead of `git commit` directly:

```bash
pnpm commit
```

This command will:

- Guide you through creating a properly formatted commit message
- Validate your commit against our rules
- Ensure all required fields are filled out correctly
- Prevent invalid commits from being created

### Commit Message Format

All commits must follow this format:

```text
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Available Types

| Type       | Description                                                   |

| `feat`     | A new feature                                                 |
| `fix`      | A bug fix                                                     |
| `docs`     | Documentation only changes                                    |
| `style`    | Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code            |
| `refactor` | A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature     |
| `perf`     | A code change that improves performance                       |
| `test`     | Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests             |
| `build`    | Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies |
| `ci`       | Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts             |
| `chore`    | Other changes that don't modify src or test files             |
| `revert`   | Reverts a previous commit                                     |

### Important Notes

- **Scope is required** - Every commit must have a scope
- **Use imperative mood** - "add feature" not "added feature"
- **Keep subject line under 100 characters**
- **No period at the end** of the subject line
- **Use the interactive tool** - `pnpm commit` ensures compliance

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Ensure your branch is up to date** with the branch you're targeting (typically `master`; `v3` only for v3-only breaking changes):

   ```bash
   git checkout <target-branch>     # master or v3
   git pull upstream <target-branch>
   git checkout your-branch
   git rebase <target-branch>
   ```

2. **Run the full test suite**:

   ```bash
   pnpm nx affected --target=test
   ```

3. **Build all affected packages**:

   ```bash
   pnpm nx affected --target=build
   ```

### Submitting Your PR

1. **Push your branch** to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```

2. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub with:
   - Clear title describing the change
   - Detailed description of what was changed and why
   - Reference any related issues
   - Screenshots or examples if applicable

### PR Requirements

All pull requests must meet these requirements:

- **✅ At least 1 approving review** from a code owner
- **✅ All status checks passing** (CI/CD pipeline)
- **✅ No merge conflicts** with the base branch
- **✅ Squash merge only** (enforced by repository settings)

### Review Process

1. **Automated checks** will run (linting, testing, building)
2. **Code owners** will be automatically requested for review
3. **Address feedback** by pushing new commits to your branch
4. **Resolve all conversations** before merge

## Testing

Each package has its own testing requirements and infrastructure. For comprehensive testing information, see:

## Documentation

### TypeScript API Documentation

We automatically generate TypeScript API documentation that is used by the main [Supabase documentation site](https://supabase.com/docs). The process works as follows:

1. **TypeDoc generates JSON specifications** from TypeScript source code
2. **GitHub Actions publishes** these specs to GitHub Pages after every successful stable release from `master`
3. **Main Supabase repository** uses these JSON files to generate the official API docs via `make` commands

#### Available Documentation Commands

```bash
# Generate JSON specs for all libraries (used by main docs)
pnpm nx run-many --target=docs:json --all

# Generate HTML docs for all libraries (for local viewing)
pnpm nx run-many --target=docs --all

# Generate docs for a specific library
pnpm nx docs:json auth-js
pnpm nx docs postgrest-js
```

#### Published API Specifications

When contributing changes that affect public APIs, the documentation will be automatically updated when your PR is merged.

## Release Process

### Fixed Version Mode

All packages in this monorepo use **fixed version mode**, meaning they share the same version number and are released together. This ensures compatibility and simplifies dependency management.

### Testing Releases

If you need to test your changes with a release build, you can use **pkg.pr.new**:

1. **Create a PR** with your changes
2. **Comment on the PR** and tag a maintainer, asking them to add the `trigger: preview` label
3. **A maintainer will add the label** to trigger the preview release
4. **Use the generated package URLs** to test your changes in other projects

This allows you to test package changes without waiting for an official release, while ensuring preview releases are controlled by maintainers.

### Official Releases

Official releases are handled by maintainers using Nx Release. You can read more in the [RELEASE.md](./RELEASE.md)
