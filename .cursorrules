# Cursor Rules for Supabase JS Libraries Monorepo

You are working in a unified Nx monorepo that consolidates all Supabase JavaScript SDKs. This migration from 6 separate repositories addresses maintenance overhead, dependency duplication, and release coordination challenges.

## Repository Context

This monorepo contains 6 JavaScript/TypeScript libraries previously maintained as separate repositories:
- `packages/core/supabase-js` - Main isomorphic client combining all libraries (@supabase/supabase-js)
- `packages/core/auth-js` - Authentication client (@supabase/auth-js)
- `packages/core/functions-js` - Edge Functions client (@supabase/functions-js)
- `packages/core/postgrest-js` - PostgREST database client (@supabase/postgrest-js)
- `packages/core/realtime-js` - Real-time subscriptions client (@supabase/realtime-js)
- `packages/core/storage-js` - File storage client (@supabase/storage-js)

## Key Principles

1. **Zero Breaking Changes**: All migrations and changes must maintain full backward compatibility for consumers
2. **Fixed Version Mode**: All packages share the same version number and are released together
3. **Workspace Dependencies**: Internal dependencies use `*` which Nx replaces with actual versions during release
4. **Complete Test Suites**: Use complete test suites for packages individually (`nx test:auth auth-js`, `nx test:storage storage-js`, etc.)
5. **Conventional Commits**: Use conventional commit format for automated versioning and changelogs

## Common Commands

### Building
- Build all: `nx run-many --target=build --all`
- Build specific: `nx build auth-js`
- Build affected: `nx affected --target=build`
- Watch mode: `nx build auth-js --watch`

### Testing
- Test specific (complete suites with Docker setup/cleanup):
  - `nx test:auth auth-js` - Complete auth-js test suite
  - `nx test:storage storage-js` - Complete storage-js test suite
  - `nx test:ci:postgrest postgrest-js` - Complete postgrest-js test suite
  - `nx test functions-js` - Standard test (uses testcontainers)
  - `nx test realtime-js` - Standard test (no Docker)
  - `nx test supabase-js` - Standard test (unit tests only)
- supabase-js additional: `nx test:all`, `nx test:unit`, `nx test:integration`, `nx test:integration:browser`, `nx test:edge-functions`, `nx test:deno`, `nx test:bun`, `nx test:expo`, `nx test:next`, `nx test:node:playwright`, `nx test:types`

### Code Quality
- Lint all: `nx run-many --target=lint --all`
- Format: `nx format`
- Check format: `nx format:check`

### Analysis
- Dependency graph: `nx graph`
- Show projects: `nx show projects`
- Affected graph: `nx affected --graph`

## Development Patterns

### Cross-Library Changes
When making changes that affect multiple libraries:
1. Make all changes in a single PR
2. Update tests in both source library and integration tests in supabase-js
3. Run complete test suites for affected packages to verify all impacts
4. Commit with clear scope: `fix(realtime-js): resolve connection issue`

### Adding New Features
1. Implement in the specific library under `packages/core/[library-name]`
2. Add comprehensive unit tests in the library's `test/` directory
3. If it affects supabase-js, add integration tests there
4. Run complete test suite for the package before committing

### Quick Fixes
Even for single-library fixes:
1. Use conventional commit: `fix(storage-js): correct upload timeout`
2. All packages will be versioned together (fixed mode)
3. Run complete test suite for the package
4. Changes ship together in next release

## TypeScript Configuration

The workspace uses strict TypeScript settings:
- Target: ES2022
- Module: NodeNext
- Strict mode enabled
- Isolated modules for performance
- Composite projects for incremental builds

## Testing Infrastructure

### Unit Tests
- Located in each library's `test/` directory
- Use Jest as test runner
- Mock external dependencies

### Integration Tests
- Libraries with external services (auth-js, storage-js, postgrest-js, functions-js) use Docker
- Complete test suites handle Docker setup/cleanup automatically:
  - `nx test:auth auth-js` - Handles Docker lifecycle
  - `nx test:storage storage-js` - Handles Docker lifecycle
  - `nx test:ci:postgrest postgrest-js` - Handles Docker lifecycle
- Manual infrastructure management available:
  - `nx test:infra auth-js` / `nx test:suite auth-js` / `nx test:clean auth-js`
  - `nx test:infra storage-js` / `nx test:suite storage-js` / `nx test:clean storage-js`
  - `nx db:run postgrest-js` / `nx test:run postgrest-js` / `nx db:clean postgrest-js`

### Cross-Platform Tests
The main supabase-js tests against:
- Node.js
- Next.js
- Expo (React Native)
- Bun runtime
- Deno runtime
- Browser environment

## File Structure Conventions

```
packages/core/[library-name]/
├── src/           # Source code
├── test/          # Test files
├── dist/          # Build output (gitignored)
├── package.json   # Package configuration
└── tsconfig.json  # TypeScript config
```

## Important Notes

- **Current Default Branch**: `master` (confirmed current default branch)
- **Original Branch Differences**: Original repos used either `master` or `main` - be aware when referencing history
- **Package Names**: All packages maintain original npm names (@supabase/[package-name])
- **Shared Code**: Extract common patterns (HTTP client, error handling) to shared packages when identified
- **Docker Required**: Integration tests for auth-js, functions-js, postgrest-js, and storage-js require Docker to be running
- **Complete Test Commands**: Use complete test suites that handle Docker automatically:
  - `nx test:auth auth-js` - Complete auth-js test suite
  - `nx test:storage storage-js` - Complete storage-js test suite
  - `nx test:ci:postgrest postgrest-js` - Complete postgrest-js test suite
  - `nx test functions-js` - Standard test (uses testcontainers)
- **Individual Commands**: Available for manual infrastructure management (see package READMEs)

## Release Process

### Fixed Version Release
All packages released with same version:
```bash
nx release              # Interactive release
nx release --dry-run    # Preview changes
nx release --yes        # CI automation
```

### Internal Dependencies
```json
// packages/core/supabase-js/package.json
"dependencies": {
  "@supabase/auth-js": "*",
  "@supabase/realtime-js": "*",
  "@supabase/functions-js": "*",
  "@supabase/storage-js": "*",
  "@supabase/postgrest-js": "*"
}
```
The `*` is replaced with actual version during release.

## Code Style

- Use Prettier for formatting (config in .prettierrc)
- Follow existing patterns in each library
- Maintain consistency across the monorepo
- Document public APIs with JSDoc comments

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. Don't hardcode version numbers for internal dependencies
2. Don't make breaking changes to public APIs
3. Don't forget to run affected tests before committing
4. Don't mix unrelated changes in a single commit
5. Don't bypass the Nx build system by running npm scripts directly for cross-library work

## When Making Suggestions

1. Always consider the monorepo structure - changes might affect multiple packages
2. Use Nx commands rather than npm/yarn directly for workspace operations
3. Suggest running complete test suites for affected packages individually
4. Remember that all packages version together in fixed mode - no independent versioning
5. Consider Docker requirements for integration tests (auth-js, functions-js, postgrest-js, storage-js)
6. Maintain backward compatibility at all costs - breaking changes require special process
7. Use complete test suites for packages with Docker: `nx test:auth auth-js`, `nx test:storage storage-js`, `nx test:ci:postgrest postgrest-js`
8. Check package READMEs for all available test commands and individual infrastructure management options
8. Always suggest conventional commit format with proper scope
9. Run complete test suites for packages individually rather than trying to run all tests together
