## Usage

First of all, you need to install the library:

```sh
npm install @supabase/supabase-js
```

Then you're able to import the library and establish the connection with the database:

```js
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

// Create a single supabase client for interacting with your database
const supabase = createClient('https://xyzcompany.supabase.co', 'public-anon-key')
```

### UMD

You can use plain `<script>`s to import supabase-js from CDNs, like:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@supabase/supabase-js@2"></script>
```

or even:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@supabase/supabase-js@2"></script>
```

Then you can use it from a global `supabase` variable:

```html
<script>
  const { createClient } = supabase
  const _supabase = createClient('https://xyzcompany.supabase.co', 'public-anon-key')

  console.log('Supabase Instance: ', _supabase)
  // ...
</script>
```

### ESM

You can use `<script type="module">` to import supabase-js from CDNs, like:

```html
<script type="module">
  import { createClient } from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@supabase/supabase-js/+esm'
  const supabase = createClient('https://xyzcompany.supabase.co', 'public-anon-key')

  console.log('Supabase Instance: ', supabase)
  // ...
</script>
```

### Deno

You can use supabase-js in the Deno runtime via [JSR](https://jsr.io/@supabase/supabase-js):

```js
import { createClient } from 'jsr:@supabase/supabase-js@2'
```

### Custom `fetch` implementation

`supabase-js` uses the [`cross-fetch`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cross-fetch) library to make HTTP requests, but an alternative `fetch` implementation can be provided as an option. This is most useful in environments where `cross-fetch` is not compatible, for instance Cloudflare Workers:

```js
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

// Provide a custom `fetch` implementation as an option
const supabase = createClient('https://xyzcompany.supabase.co', 'public-anon-key', {
  global: {
    fetch: (...args) => fetch(...args),
  },
})
```

## Support Policy

This section outlines the scope of support for various runtime environments in Supabase JavaScript client.

### Node.js

We only support Node.js versions that are in **Active LTS** or **Maintenance** status as defined by the [official Node.js release schedule](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases#release-schedule). This means we support versions that are currently receiving long-term support and critical bug fixes.

When a Node.js version reaches end-of-life and is no longer in Active LTS or Maintenance status, Supabase will drop it in a **minor release**, and **this won't be considered a breaking change**.

### Deno

We support Deno versions that are currently receiving active development and security updates. We follow the [official Deno release schedule](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/fundamentals/stability_and_releases/) and only support versions from the `stable` and `lts` release channels.

When a Deno version reaches end-of-life and is no longer receiving security updates, Supabase will drop it in a **minor release**, and **this won't be considered a breaking change**.
