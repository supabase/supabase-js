## Why We Migrated

The `supabase-js` repository has been converted into a Nx monorepo and the other js client libraries have been absorbed into it to solve several critical challenges:

### Problems with Separate Repos

- **Version Drift**: Libraries could have incompatible versions in production
- **Manual Dependency Updates**: Updating internal dependencies required coordinated PRs across repos
- **Duplicated CI/CD**: Each repo maintained its own pipeline configuration
- **Complex Testing**: Integration testing across libraries was difficult
- **Inconsistent Tooling**: Different repos used different build and test setups
- **Release Coordination**: Coordinating releases across dependent packages was error-prone

### Benefits of the Monorepo

- **Fixed Versioning**: All packages share a single version number
- **Automatic Dependency Updates**: Internal dependencies update automatically
- **Unified CI/CD**: Single pipeline with intelligent affected detection
- **Simplified Testing**: Easy integration testing across all libraries
- **Consistent Tooling**: One build system, one test runner, one format
- **Atomic Changes**: Make coordinated changes across multiple packages in one PR
- **Better DX**: Nx provides powerful caching, affected commands, and dependency visualization

## What Changed

### Repository Structure

**Before:** 6 separate repositories

```tree
github.com/supabase/supabase-js
github.com/supabase/auth-js
github.com/supabase/postgrest-js
github.com/supabase/realtime-js
github.com/supabase/storage-js
github.com/supabase/functions-js
```

**After:** The Supabase JS monorepo (absorbed all client libraries)

```tree
github.com/supabase/supabase-js
â”œâ”€â”€ packages/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ core/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ supabase-js/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ auth-js/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ postgrest-js/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ realtime-js/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ storage-js/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ functions-js/
```

### Development Workflow

| Task                     | Old Workflow                     | New Workflow                                  |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Clone & Setup**        | Clone each repo individually     | Clone once: `git clone supabase/supabase-js`  |
| **Install Dependencies** | `npm install` in each repo       | Single `npm install` at root                  |
| **Build a Library**      | `npm run build` in specific repo | `npx nx build auth-js`                          |
| **Test a Library**       | `npm test` in specific repo      | `npx nx test postgrest-js`                      |
| **Format Code**          | Various tools per repo           | `npx nx format`                                 |
| **Release**              | Individual releases per repo     | Single coordinated release                      |

### Versioning Strategy

- **Before**: Each package had independent versions (e.g., auth@2.1.0, storage@1.5.3)
- **After**: All packages share the same version (e.g., everything at 2.5.0)
- **Benefit**: No more compatibility matrices or version conflicts

Read more about the release process in [RELEASE.md](./RELEASE.md).

## Repository Mapping

Here's where to find your familiar code in the new structure:

| Old Repository          | New Location                  | Package Name (unchanged!) |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `supabase/supabase-js`  | `packages/core/supabase-js/`  | `@supabase/supabase-js`   |
| `supabase/auth-js`      | `packages/core/auth-js/`      | `@supabase/auth-js`       |
| `supabase/postgrest-js` | `packages/core/postgrest-js/` | `@supabase/postgrest-js`  |
| `supabase/realtime-js`  | `packages/core/realtime-js/`  | `@supabase/realtime-js`   |
| `supabase/storage-js`   | `packages/core/storage-js/`   | `@supabase/storage-js`    |
| `supabase/functions-js` | `packages/core/functions-js/` | `@supabase/functions-js`  |

### Important Files

Each library maintains its structure, but some files are now centralized:

- **Root `package.json`**: Workspace configuration and shared dev dependencies
- **Root `nx.json`**: Nx workspace configuration
- **Root `.github/`**: Unified CI/CD workflows
- **Library `package.json`**: Still exists for each library with its specific dependencies
- **Library `tsconfig.json`**: Extends from root but maintains library-specific settings

## Migration Steps

### For Contributors with Existing Work

If you have uncommitted changes or an active branch in an old repository, you'll need to manually port your work to the new monorepo:

#### Step 1: Set up the new monorepo

```bash
# Fork github.com/supabase/supabase-js on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/supabase-js.git
cd supabase-js
npm install

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js.git
git fetch upstream

# Create your feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

#### Step 2: Manually port your changes

1. **Open your old repository** in another window/tab
2. **Copy your modified files** to the new structure:
   - Old: `auth-js/src/GoTrueClient.ts`
   - New: `packages/core/auth-js/src/GoTrueClient.ts`
3. **Commit using the interactive tool**:

   ```bash
   npm run commit
   ```

### For Active Pull Requests

We're working with contributors who have open PRs to handle the migration case-by-case. If you have an open PR:

- **Reach out to maintainers** in your existing PR
- We'll help you either merge it quickly or assist with porting to the monorepo

### For Projects Depending on Supabase Libraries

No changes needed for end users! The published npm packages remain the same:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@supabase/supabase-js": "^2.0.0",
    "@supabase/auth-js": "^2.0.0"
  }
}
```

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: "I was working on a bug fix in postgrest-js"

```bash
# make changes to packages/core/postgrest-js/src/PostgrestClient.ts
npm run commit  # Use interactive commit tool
# Select: fix > postgrest > "resolve filter issue"
```

### Scenario 2: "I need to update auth-js and test it with supabase-js"

```bash
# This was complex before - required npm link or multiple PRs
# Now it's simple:

# Make changes to auth-js
edit packages/core/auth-js/src/GoTrueClient.ts

# Test auth-js alone
npx nx test auth-js

# Test with supabase-js integration
npx nx test supabase-js

# Build both to ensure compatibility
npx nx run-many --target=build --projects=auth-js,supabase-js

# Commit both changes atomically
npm run commit
# feat(auth): add new auth feature with supabase-js integration
```

### Scenario 3: "I want to add a feature that touches multiple packages"

```bash
# Create your feature branch
git checkout -b feature/multi-package-update

# Make changes across packages
edit packages/core/auth-js/src/lib/feature.ts
edit packages/core/supabase-js/src/SupabaseClient.ts
edit packages/core/realtime-js/src/RealtimeClient.ts

# Build all affected packages
npx nx affected --target=build

# Commit with appropriate scope
npm run commit
# feat(supabase): add cross-package feature for X functionality
```

### Scenario 4: "I need to run integration tests"

```bash
# Old way: Complex Docker setup per repo

# New way: Integrated Docker management
npx nx test auth-js        # Automatically sets up GoTrue
npx nx test storage-js     # Automatically sets up Storage server

# Run all integration tests
npx nx run-many --target=test:integration --all
```

### Library Name Reference

Use these names with Nx commands:

- `auth-js` - Auth library
- `functions-js` - Functions library
- `postgrest-js` - PostgREST library
- `realtime-js` - Realtime library
- `storage-js` - Storage library
- `supabase-js` - Main client library

### Useful New Commands

Commands that weren't available in separate repos:

```bash
# Visualize project dependencies
npx nx graph

# Build only what changed since main
npx nx affected --target=build --base=main

# Test only what changed
npx nx affected --target=test

# Run test/build for a specific project
npx nx test auth-js
npx nx build auth-js

# See what would be affected by your changes
npx nx show projects --affected

# Run multiple targets in parallel
npx nx run-many --target=build,test --all --parallel=3

# Generate documentation
npx nx run-many --target=docs --all
```

## FAQ

### Q: Why fixed versioning instead of independent versions?

**A:** Fixed versioning ensures all Supabase JS libraries are always compatible with each other. Users don't need to worry about compatibility matrices or which version of auth-js works with which version of supabase-js.

### Q: Can I still work on just one library?

**A:** Absolutely! The monorepo structure doesn't mean you have to work on everything. You can focus on a single library:

```bash
npx nx build auth-js --watch
npx nx test auth-js --watch
```

### Q: How do releases work now?

**A:** All packages are released together with the same version number. When we release v2.5.0, all six packages get v2.5.0. This is automated through Nx Release and semantic-release. Read more on [`RELEASE.md`](./RELEASE.md).

### Q: Will old issues and PRs be migrated?

**A:** Open issues are being triaged and migrated as appropriate. For open PRs, we'll work with contributors individually. Check the old repo for a migration notice.

### Q: How do I know which files to edit?

**A:** The structure within each package is the same as before. If you edited `src/GoTrueClient.ts` in the old auth-js repo, you'll now edit `packages/core/auth-js/src/GoTrueClient.ts`.

### Q: Do I need to learn Nx?

**A:** Not really! Basic commands are enough for most contributions. Nx handles the complexity behind the scenes. The main commands you need are `nx build`, `nx test`, and `nx affected`.

### Q: What about my Git history?

**A:** The Git history from all individual repos has been preserved during the migration. You can still see the history of individual files using:

```bash
git log --follow packages/core/auth-js/src/GoTrueClient.ts
```

### Q: Can I still install packages individually?

**A:** Yes! End users still install packages individually from npm:

```bash
npm install @supabase/auth-js
npm install @supabase/supabase-js
```

### Q: What if I find a bug in the migration?

**A:** Please [open an issue](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js/issues) and tag it with `migration`. We're actively monitoring these during the transition period.
