# Testing Guide

This monorepo uses Nx for orchestrating tests across all packages. Each package has its own testing requirements and infrastructure.

## Quick Start

To run tests for any package:

```bash
# Basic pattern
npx nx test <package-name>

# Examples
npx nx test auth-js
npx nx test:storage storage-js  # Special command for storage-js
npx nx test postgrest-js
```

## Package-Specific Testing Guides

Each package has unique testing requirements. Please refer to the individual README files for detailed instructions:

### Core Packages

| Package          | Docker Required                          | Test Command                     | Documentation                                                 |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **auth-js**      | ✅ Yes (GoTrue + PostgreSQL)             | `npx nx test:auth auth-js`       | [Testing Guide](packages/core/auth-js/README.md#testing)      |
| **functions-js** | ✅ Yes (Deno relay via testcontainers)   | `npx nx test functions-js`       | [Testing Guide](packages/core/functions-js/README.md#testing) |
| **postgrest-js** | ✅ Yes (PostgREST + PostgreSQL)          | `npx nx test postgrest-js`       | [Testing Guide](packages/core/postgrest-js/README.md#testing) |
| **realtime-js**  | ❌ No (uses mock WebSockets)             | `npx nx test realtime-js`        | [Testing Guide](packages/core/realtime-js/README.md#testing)  |
| **storage-js**   | ✅ Yes (Storage API + PostgreSQL + Kong) | `npx nx test:storage storage-js` | [Testing Guide](packages/core/storage-js/README.md#testing)   |
| **supabase-js**  | ❌ No (unit tests only)                  | `npx nx test supabase-js`        | [Testing Guide](packages/core/supabase-js/README.md#testing)  |

### Common Test Commands

```bash
# Run tests with coverage
npx nx test <package> --coverage

# Run tests in watch mode
npx nx test <package> --watch

# Run all tests across the monorepo
npx nx run-many --target=test --all
```

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** - Required for all packages
- **Docker** - Required for auth-js, functions-js, postgrest-js, and storage-js
- **Ports** - Various packages use different ports for test infrastructure (see individual READMEs)

## CI Testing

In CI environments, tests are run automatically using GitHub Actions. The CI pipeline:

1. Sets up Node.js and Docker
2. Installs dependencies
3. Runs tests for all affected packages
4. Generates coverage reports

For CI-specific test commands, many packages have a `test:ci` target that includes coverage reporting.

## Troubleshooting

For package-specific issues, consult the troubleshooting section in each package's README. Common issues:

- **Port conflicts**: Check if required ports are already in use
- **Docker not running**: Ensure Docker Desktop is started
- **Container cleanup**: Use `npx nx test:clean <package>` if containers weren't properly removed

## Contributing Tests

When adding new features or fixing bugs:

1. Write tests that cover your changes
2. Ensure all existing tests pass
3. Update test documentation if you change testing infrastructure
4. Follow the testing patterns established in each package
